# Creating/downloading a model and adding it to the game via Blender

## Beginning

First, familiarize yourself with the limitations and capabilities of the format [.object](file-formats/.object.md) (because you may export to it more often than to .ogf) to avoid errors.

## Start

Create or download the model you like.
Do a UV sweep if you don't have one.

### Example:

The model itself:
![model-example](blender-images/model-example.png)

UV:
![model-example-uv](blender-images/model-example-UV.png)

## Texturing

Textures can be created in any program designed for this purpose, or you can simply download them.
